# LeetCode JS Challenge - Progress Log

This repository tracks my progress through the [30-Day LeetCode JavaScript Challenge](https://leetcode.com/studyplan/30-days-of-javascript/).

My goal is to complete two problems per day. Each solution folder contains:
* `solution.js`: The final, accepted code.
* `README.md`: A detailed explanation of the problem, my thought process, and the time/space complexity.
